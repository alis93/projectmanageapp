# projectmanageapp

My final year project built using mongoDB, angularjs and nodeJS.

Project to allow teams to share and assign tasks, track activity and share files.

Uses mongoDB for data storage and aggregation.
Uses Angularjs 1.x for front end with material design
Uses express and Nodejs for backend.

Authentication uses JWT and passportJS.

Includes use of other libraries for features such as graphing and text editing. 

The backend routes really need to be modularised and split into database, api and service layers!
